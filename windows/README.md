# Windows Scripting Utility Repository

This repository houses a collection of utility scripts crafted to streamline various tasks on Windows 10. These scripts are written in batch and PowerShell. Here's a quick guide to help you get started with these scripts:

## Utilizing Batch and PowerShell Scripts

Batch and PowerShell scripts are potent tools capable of automating tasks and enhancing your productivity. Here’s how you can utilize and modify these scripts:

### Creating and Editing Batch Scripts

1. **Creating a Script**: Create a new text file (`.txt`) and rename the extension to `.bat` to convert it into a batch script.
2. **Editing a Script**: To modify the content of a batch script, simply change the extension from `.bat` to `.txt` and open it in a text editor to make necessary changes.
