# Pingu - Parallel Ping Program

Pingu is a simple C program that sends pings to a target IP address at a specified frequency while displaying the number of successful pings in parallel.

## Compilation

To compile the program, use the following command in the directory containing the source file (e.g., pingu.c):

```bash
gcc -o pingu pingu.c -lpthread
```

## Usage

The program takes two command-line arguments:
1. **Target IP address**: The IP address of the machine to which pings will be sent.
2. **Number of pings per second**: The frequency at which to send pings.

Run the program with the following command:

```bash
./pingu <target_ip_address> <number_of_pings_per_second>
```

For example, to send pings to the IP address 192.168.1.XX at a frequency of 5 pings per second, use the following command:

```bash
./pingu 192.168.1.XX 5
```

The program will continuously display the number of pings sent and the number of successful pings in parallel. To stop the program and display the final statistics, press `Ctrl+C`.

## Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary access rights to create raw sockets. If necessary, use `sudo` to run the program with elevated privileges.
- Do not use this program abusively, as massive ping sending can affect network and target machine performance.
- This program is provided as-is, without any warranty. Use it responsibly and in compliance with local laws and regulations.

- You can verify if your packets are being sent by checking with Wireshark using the filter:

```
icmp and ip.src == 192.168.1.XX 
```

Replacing the address with the ping target.

If you are using Linux, you can also use:

```
sudo tcpdump icmp
```

## Dummy Interface (Optional)

If you encounter issues capturing local ICMP packets, you can create and use a dummy interface. To do this:

1. **Create a dummy interface:**

   ```bash
   sudo ip link add dummy0 type dummy
   ```

2. **Activate the dummy interface:**

   ```bash
   sudo ip link set dummy0 up
   ```

3. **Activate promiscuous mode on the dummy interface:**

   ```bash
   sudo ip link set dummy0 promisc on
   ```

To remove the dummy interface after use:

```bash
sudo ip link delete dummy0
```
