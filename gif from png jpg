#You have to download python first
#and maybe download PIL by running this in your CMD :


#     py -m pip install PIL

#Then just paste your images you want to turns into a gif
#in the directory you want, put this script in the directory
#Do left clic on the script then "open with", "python"

#The gif will be created in the same directory

#----/!\-----/!\-----/!\-----/!\-----/!\-----/!\----#
#                                                   #
#    DO NOT FORGET to change directories paths      #
#       at begining and end of this script          #
#                                                   #
