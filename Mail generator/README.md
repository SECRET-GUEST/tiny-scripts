this is the first python script I've ever done I think, it's definitely not optimized but it does the work x)

For the story, I did it to overkill database of 2 random Russians "web designers" based in Khazakstan who was harassing a friend of mine with their scam phishing page.

(I will not share the program I used to send the mails sorry, even for educational purpose you don't need it because it could be dangerous for yourself)

So this random mail generator is really easy to use or re-write, it will generate random mail from dictionaries.

Both French and Russian versions are available.
