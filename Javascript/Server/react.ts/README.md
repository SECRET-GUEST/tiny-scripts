This repository contains two scripts (`reacTsx.bat` for Windows and `reacTsx.sh` for Linux/macOS) to quickly set up a new React project with TypeScript and a custom folder structure. You can choose between two different project structures, one for a basic setup and another for a setup with Three.js integration.
