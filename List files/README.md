Here are little useful scripts to manage files under windows.
**For people who don't use/ know batch, I put a tutorial at the end of this file.**

# How is it working ?

## 1.list files in the directory.bat

It will returns you a text with all informations about the folder where you ran the script, and the files in.
This is useful to make wordlists.

=> You just have to download the file and click on it

## 2.Rename all files in the directory.bat

This will rename all .png files or whatever extension you want in the folder where you placed this program

=> You have to change into the script the extension ".png" if you want to run it for something else than PNG images.

## 3.create a simple Wordlist.py 

Create a simple wordlist of 1.png, 2.png ,... 500.png

=> Needs to download python then use left click on the file, "open with", "python".

=> You have to change the path inside the python file replacing by yours, all instructions in the script.


```
_  _ ____ ____ ___  _  _ ____ ____ 
|\ | |  | |  | |__] |  | | __ [__  
| \| |__| |__| |__] |__| |__] ___] 
 ``` 
 

## Open Python files :
To manage python file you can use the softwares; 

Python : https://www.python.org/downloads/

visual studio code : https://code.visualstudio.com/download 

or notepad++ : https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/

## Rewrite or open batch files:

Batch script is a Microsoft language so it will not work for Linux or Mac.

You just have to create a new file.txt, then change the .txt to .bat or reverse if you want to change the code inside.

If you can't rewrite the extension you may have to open any file you want (Document or whatever) then go to display upside of the searchbar then tick the box asking you if you want to see the filename extension.
